NHSEMP is the Native Hawaiian Science & Engineering Mentorship Program here at UH Manoa and they offer a huge range of program dedicating to enhacing our communities with a strong devotion to perserving and maintaing success for Hawaiian Heritage and Culture. One such program that especially helps unite our community is called "Stem Day" and revolves around building a fun KiwiCo kit with dozens of famalies all together in real-time over Zoom in order to provide a comfortable and fun experience for the next generation. This gives the children time to bond with thier famalies and get amazing creations out of it aswell. Throughout the sessions Kumu like me show or explain detailed instructions on how to construct the kits as well and provide information on what some of the items in list are called in Hawaiian. We often drop such keywords throughout and on special occasions give them history on Hawaiian cultre and legacy.

My job generally is either to be the "hands" (Creating the kit alongisde the Ohana) or the "voice" (Explaining the steps verbally in a clear and concise manner). I've been both of these roles before and have a handful of Stem Days that I've been lucky enough to be apart of. Both roles require abit of knowledge on relevent Hawaiian keywords and the ability to cut through that empty space when everyone is silently toiling away at thier creations. We create a fun and welcoming enviroment to those who wishe to pursure that curiosity in engieering and promote the growth in their ambition. The exoeriences have taught me how to be more concise with my wording while still cutting through that initial unease and tension and has provided me with an amazing oppurtunity to share the Aloha with Ohana across the seas.
